# CODSOFT--Task-3-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This repository contains a project focused on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn prediction aims to identify customers who are likely to stop using a product or service in the near future. By analyzing historical customer data and behavioral patterns, the model provides businesses with actionable insights to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

### Implementation

1. Data Collection and Understanding:
   
The dataset used in this project typically contains customer attributes such as age, location, tenure, product usage, customer support interactions, and subscription type. The target variable is whether the customer churned (1) or remained with the company (0). Data understanding involves exploring the relationships between these features and churn, identifying trends, and checking for any data imbalances or anomalies.

2. Data Preprocessing:

Handling Missing Data: Missing values are imputed or removed.
Feature Engineering: New features are created, and categorical features are encoded. For example, tenure can be categorized into short, medium, and long, and customer service calls can be converted into a binary indicator of high/low interaction.
Data Scaling: Normalization or standardization is applied to features to ensure they are on the same scale.
Class Imbalance Handling: Since churn is often an imbalanced problem (with fewer churn cases), techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using algorithms like SMOTE are used to balance the dataset.

3. Model Building:

Logistic Regression: A simple, interpretable model suitable for binary classification problems.
Random Forest: A powerful ensemble model that uses decision trees to make predictions and handle non-linear relationships.

4. Model Evaluation:
   
Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model's predictions.
Precision & Recall: Measures to evaluate the modelâ€™s ability to correctly identify churners while minimizing false positives and false negatives.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.

5. Model Optimization:
 
After the initial evaluation, we optimize the models through hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and feature selection to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Techniques like cross-validation are used to select the best-performing model.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to predict customer churn, offering businesses actionable insights to reduce customer turnover. By implementing and comparing multiple models, we provide a comprehensive approach to understanding and predicting churn, ultimately helping organizations retain valuable customers. Future improvements could involve using additional data sources or more complex models to further enhance predictive power.
